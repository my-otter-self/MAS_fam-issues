    m 3eub "While it is a common thought that war can cause PTSD. {w=0.2} That is just often times not the case."
    m 1eub "Almost all cases of PTSD stem from great amounts of stress or trauma!"
    m 2eud "To put it bluntly, any person who has encountered a traumatic event of any kind has a chance of developing PTSD."

    m 7rtd "The acronym PTSD stands for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and with the name the defintion is essentially given."
    m 1eksdru "PTSD is a mental disorder that occurs after a traumatic event. Not a very descriptive defintion is it [mas_get_player_nickname()]."
    m 1mkc "Actually it's pretty sad, PTSD is described to naturally occur after a traumatic event takes place."
    m 3ekd "However, PTSD is usually only diagnosed when it becomes Chronic. You see [player], in most cases when we go through a traumatic experience our mind will overcome and heal from this naturally overtime."
    m 3esd "This is why you don't have nightmares about graphic childhood injuries. This is also why, not every  dangerous experience you have can give you PTSD."
    m 1ekc "The event just has to have such an impact on your mind can't fully process and move on from it." 
    m 1dkd "What's even more saddening, is that people are only able to recieve a diagnois of PTSD a year after symptoms are recognized."

        m 1rtd "Actually thinking back on it, she probably did have PTSD even if the symptoms don't fully develop til a few months after the occurence..."
        m 7etd "I mean she started displaying avoidance behaviours with both Yuri and I, and her outbursts of frustartion even got worse--specifically, the one with Yuri."
